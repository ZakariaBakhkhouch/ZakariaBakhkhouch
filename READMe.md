### Hello World 👋, I am Zakaria Bakhkhouch!

---
I'm a passionate .NET developer with over 4 years of experience in developing web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API. I'm always striving to learn new technologies and improve my skills, and I enjoy working on challenging projects that push me to grow as a developer.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, playing video games, or playing football.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to see some of my projects, or connect with me on LinkedIn to discuss potential collaboration opportunities.
